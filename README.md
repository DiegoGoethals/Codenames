# Codenames
## Description
This is the boardgame of Codenames I had to make in my first year at UGent for the course scripting languages

## How to run the project
- Download the project locally
- In your terminal or IDE go to the root folder of this project
- run `python -m http.server --cgi` (This could also be python2 or more likely python3, depending on what version of Python you have installed)
- Open up `localhost:8000` or what port it gives you
- Now the project is running and you can test it out
